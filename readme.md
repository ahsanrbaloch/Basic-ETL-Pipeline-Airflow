# Comprehensive Report on Data Preprocessing, DVC Setup, and Airflow Integration

## Introduction
This report documents the workflow for data preprocessing and the setup of Data Version Control (DVC) for managing data files. The project involves extracting data from BBC and Dawn websites, transforming it, and then loading it into a CSV file. Additionally, DVC is used to version and track changes to the data files. The report also covers the integration of Apache Airflow for orchestrating the data preprocessing workflow. It provides insights into the implementation process, including challenges encountered and solutions employed.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
The data preprocessing steps involve three main stages:

### 1. Data Extraction
- Utilizing web scraping techniques to extract data from the BBC and Dawn websites.
- Extracting relevant information such as article titles and descriptions from the HTML content.
- Parsing the HTML using the BeautifulSoup library to extract links and article content.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Cleaning and preprocessing the extracted data.
- Performing tasks such as text normalization, removing stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
- Transforming the data to a structured format suitable for analysis and further processing.

### 3. Data Loading
- Saving the preprocessed data to a CSV file for storage and future use.

## DVC Setup
The setup of DVC involves several steps to enable versioning and tracking of data files:

### 1. Initialization
- Initializing DVC in the project directory using the `dvc init` command.

### 2. Adding Data Files
- Adding the data files to DVC using the `dvc add` command. This creates corresponding DVC metafiles for tracking changes.

### 3. Remote Setup
- Adding a remote storage location (e.g., Google Drive) using the `dvc remote add` command. This allows data to be pushed to remote storage for backup and collaboration.

### 4. Default Remote
- Setting the default remote storage using the `dvc remote default` command. This specifies the remote location where data will be pushed by default.

### 5. Data Versioning
- Versioning data files using DVC. Changes to data files are tracked, allowing for easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

### 6. Pushing Data
- Pushing data files to remote storage using the `dvc push` command. This ensures that data changes are synchronized with the remote repository.

## Airflow Setup

### Installation
- Install Apache Airflow using pip: `pip install apache-airflow`
  
### Initialization
- Initialize the Airflow database: `airflow db init`

### Configuration
- Modify the Airflow configuration file (`airflow.cfg`) to set up the necessary configurations such as executor type, parallelism, and concurrency.

### DAG Deployment
- Define the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) script for the data preprocessing workflow.
- Place the DAG script in the Airflow DAGs directory (usually located at `$AIRFLOW_HOME/dags`).

### Start Airflow Scheduler and Web Server
- Start the Airflow scheduler: `airflow scheduler`

- Start the Airflow web server: `airflow webserver`

### Accessing Airflow UI
- Open a web browser and navigate to the Airflow web server URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
- Log in to the Airflow UI using the credentials configured during installation.

### DAG Execution
- Trigger the DAG manually from the Airflow UI or use the Airflow CLI to trigger DAG runs.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor DAG execution and task status from the Airflow UI.
- View logs and task outputs to debug any issues encountered during DAG execution.

### Scaling
- Scale Airflow components such as scheduler, worker, and web server based on workload requirements.
- Configure Airflow to use a distributed executor (e.g., CeleryExecutor) for parallel task execution.

### Integration with DVC
- Integrate Airflow with DVC to manage data versioning and pipeline execution.
- Use DVC commands within Airflow tasks to track changes to data files and ensure reproducibility of data preprocessing workflows.

## Conclusion
Data preprocessing and version control are critical aspects of data science projects. By following a structured workflow and leveraging tools like DVC, data can be efficiently managed, tracked, and versioned throughout its lifecycle. Despite the challenges encountered, the successful implementation of data preprocessing and DVC setup ensures the integrity and reliability of the data for analysis and decision-making purposes.

This comprehensive report provides insights into the workflow, challenges faced, and solutions employed during the implementation of data preprocessing and DVC setup in the project.
