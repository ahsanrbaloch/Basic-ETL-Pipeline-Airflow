# Data Preprocessing and DVC Setup Report

## Introduction
This report outlines the workflow for data preprocessing and the setup of Data Version Control (DVC) for managing data files. The preprocessing steps include data extraction, transformation, and loading, while DVC is used for versioning and tracking changes to the data files.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from BBC and Dawn websites using web scraping techniques. Extract relevant information such as article titles and descriptions.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the extracted data. Perform tasks such as text normalization, removing stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
3. **Data Loading**: Save the preprocessed data to a CSV file.

## DVC Setup
1. **Initialization**: Initialize DVC in the project directory using the `dvc init` command.
2. **Adding Data Files**: Add the data files to DVC using the `dvc add` command. This creates corresponding DVC metafiles for tracking changes.
3. **Remote Setup**: Add a remote storage location (e.g., Google Drive) using the `dvc remote add` command. This allows data to be pushed to remote storage for backup and collaboration.
4. **Default Remote**: Set the default remote storage using the `dvc remote default` command. This specifies the remote location where data will be pushed by default.
5. **Data Versioning**: Version data files using DVC. Changes to data files are tracked, allowing for easy rollback to previous versions if needed.
6. **Pushing Data**: Push data files to remote storage using the `dvc push` command. This ensures that data changes are synchronized with the remote repository.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring the quality of extracted data posed challenges, such as handling missing values and noisy data.
- **DVC Configuration**: Configuring DVC for the first time required understanding its commands and workflow. Setting up remotes and managing data versions required careful consideration.

## Conclusion
Data preprocessing and DVC setup are essential steps in data science projects. By following a structured workflow and leveraging tools like DVC, data can be efficiently managed and tracked throughout its lifecycle.
