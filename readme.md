## Introduction
This report documents the workflow for data preprocessing and the setup of Data Version Control (DVC) for managing data files. The project involves extracting data from BBC and Dawn websites, transforming it, and then loading it into a CSV file. Additionally, DVC is used to version and track changes to the data files. This report provides insights into the implementation process, including challenges encountered and solutions employed.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
The data preprocessing steps involve three main stages:

### 1. Data Extraction
- Utilizing web scraping techniques to extract data from the BBC and Dawn websites.
- Extracting relevant information such as article titles and descriptions from the HTML content.
- Parsing the HTML using the BeautifulSoup library to extract links and article content.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Cleaning and preprocessing the extracted data.
- Performing tasks such as text normalization, removing stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.
- Transforming the data to a structured format suitable for analysis and further processing.

### 3. Data Loading
- Saving the preprocessed data to a CSV file for storage and future use.

## DVC Setup
The setup of DVC involves several steps to enable versioning and tracking of data files:

### 1. Initialization
- Initializing DVC in the project directory using the `dvc init` command.

### 2. Adding Data Files
- Adding the data files to DVC using the `dvc add` command. This creates corresponding DVC metafiles for tracking changes.

### 3. Remote Setup
- Adding a remote storage location (e.g., Google Drive) using the `dvc remote add` command. This allows data to be pushed to remote storage for backup and collaboration.

### 4. Default Remote
- Setting the default remote storage using the `dvc remote default` command. This specifies the remote location where data will be pushed by default.

### 5. Data Versioning
- Versioning data files using DVC. Changes to data files are tracked, allowing for easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

### 6. Pushing Data
- Pushing data files to remote storage using the `dvc push` command. This ensures that data changes are synchronized with the remote repository.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring the quality of extracted data posed challenges, such as handling missing values and noisy data. Robust data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were employed to address this challenge.
- **DVC Configuration**: Configuring DVC for the first time required understanding its commands and workflow. Setting up remotes and managing data versions required careful consideration.
- **Airflow Integration**: Setting up and running the DAG script on Airflow was challenging initially. Configuration issues and dependency management required troubleshooting to ensure smooth execution.

## Conclusion
Data preprocessing and version control are critical aspects of data science projects. By following a structured workflow and leveraging tools like DVC, data can be efficiently managed, tracked, and versioned throughout its lifecycle. Despite the challenges encountered, the successful implementation of data preprocessing and DVC setup ensures the integrity and reliability of the data for analysis and decision-making purposes.

This comprehensive report provides insights into the workflow, challenges faced, and solutions employed during the implementation of data preprocessing and DVC setup in the project.
